'''Why it’s efficient:

Each number from 2 to n is processed once.

Checking the three options (−1, ÷2, ÷3) is constant time per number.

Reconstruction of the path is O(n) worst-case.

For n = 10^6, it runs comfortably within time limits.

This is basically the standard solution used in competitive programming for this problem.'''
